This version is to verify if I use the latest version.

### NEW FEATURES

  * None
  
### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Added `razzo_params$misc_params$razzo_version` to store the version of
    `razzo` that created the parameters.
    First version is `0.8.1.1` (this one), older versions are set 
    to `0.8.1` (the previous version)

### BUG FIXES

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * None

## razzo 0.8 (2020-01-09)

### NEW FEATURES

  * Use `raztr`
  
### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

### BUG FIXES

  * Use `getwd()` in `collect_` functions to let the scripts in `razzo_project`
    work on the local files, instead of on the `raztr` files

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * None
