\alias{collect_n_taxa}
\title{Collect the number of taxa for analyses.}
\usage{
collect_n_taxa(project_folder_name = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{project_folder_name}{project folder name,
will be the full path to \code{razzo_project}}
}
\value{
a dataframe with folder and taxa number for each phylogeny
}
\description{
Collect number of taxa
}
\details{
After a razzo experiment is run, this function extracts the number
of taxa from the resulting files. In practice, this number is extracted
from all files named \code{mbd.tree} or \code{pbd.newick}.
}
\examples{
library(testthat)
library(raztr)

df <- collect_n_taxa(
  project_folder_name = get_raztr_path("razzo_project")
)

expect_true("folder" \%in\% names(df))
expect_true("n_taxa" \%in\% names(df))
expect_true(is.character(df$folder))
expect_true(is.numeric(df$n_taxa))
}
